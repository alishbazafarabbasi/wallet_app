## Recent Blockhash

### What is a Recent Blockhash?

- **Definition:** A recent blockhash is a unique identifier for the most recent block in the Solana blockchain, represented as a 32-byte value or a hexadecimal string.
- **Purpose:** It ensures the validity of transactions and prevents replay attacks by associating transactions with the most recent blockchain state.

### Role in Transactions

- **Transaction Validity:** Ensures transactions are valid and based on the latest blockchain state.
- **Transaction Confirmation:** Nodes verify transactions using the recent blockhash.
- **Preventing Replay Attacks:** Unique to the block it was created for, preventing transactions from being replayed.
